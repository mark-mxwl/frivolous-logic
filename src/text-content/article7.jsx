      The Rubik's Cube is a 3-D combination puzzle invented in 1974 by
      Hungarian sculptor and professor of architecture Ernő Rubik. Originally
      called the Magic Cube, the puzzle was licensed by Rubik to be sold by
      Pentangle Puzzles in the UK in 1978, and then by Ideal Toy Corp in
      1980 via businessman Tibor Laczi and Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer.

      In March 1970, Larry D. Nichols invented a 2×2×2 "Puzzle with Pieces
      Rotatable in Groups" and filed a Canadian patent application for it.
      Nichols's cube was held together by magnets. Nichols was granted U.S.
      Patent 3,655,201 on 11 April 1972, two years before Rubik invented his
      Cube.

      On 9 April 1970, Frank Fox applied to patent an "amusement device", a type
      of sliding puzzle on a spherical surface with "at least two 3×3 arrays"
      intended to be used for the game of noughts and crosses. He received his
      UK patent (1344259) on 16 January 1974.

      Packaging of Rubik's Cube, Toy of the year 1980 – Ideal Toy Corp., made in
      Hungary In the mid-1970s, Ernő Rubik worked at the Department of Interior
      Design at the Academy of Applied Arts and Crafts in Budapest. Although it
      is widely reported that the Cube was built as a teaching tool to help his
      students understand 3D objects, his actual purpose was solving the
      structural problem of moving the parts independently without the entire
      mechanism falling apart. He did not realise that he had created a puzzle
      until the first time he scrambled his new Cube and then tried to restore
      it. Rubik applied for a patent in Hungary for his "Magic Cube" (Hungarian:
      Bűvös kocka) on 30 January 1975, and HU170062 was granted later that year.

      The first test batches of the Magic Cube were produced in late 1977 and
      released in Budapest toy shops. Magic Cube was held together with
      interlocking plastic pieces that prevented the puzzle from being easily
      pulled apart, unlike the magnets in Nichols's design. With Ernő Rubik's
      permission, businessman Tibor Laczi took a Cube to Germany's Nuremberg Toy
      Fair in February 1979 in an attempt to popularise it. It was noticed by
      Seven Towns founder Tom Kremer, and they signed a deal with Ideal Toys in
      September 1979 to release the Magic Cube worldwide. Ideal wanted at least
      a recognisable name to trademark; that arrangement put Rubik in the
      spotlight because the Magic Cube was renamed after its inventor in 1980.
      The puzzle made its international debut at the toy fairs of London, Paris,
      Nuremberg, and New York in January and February 1980.

      After its international debut, the progress of the Cube towards the toy
      shop shelves of the West was briefly halted so that it could be
      manufactured to Western safety and packaging specifications. A lighter
      Cube was produced, and Ideal decided to rename it. "The Gordian Knot" and
      "Inca Gold" were considered, but the company finally decided on "Rubik's
      Cube", and the first batch was exported from Hungary in May 1980.
