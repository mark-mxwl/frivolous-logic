      The tangram (Chinese: 七巧板; pinyin: qīqiǎobǎn; lit. 'seven boards of
      skill') is a dissection puzzle consisting of seven flat polygons, called
      tans, which are put together to form shapes. The objective is to replicate
      a pattern (given only an outline) generally found in a puzzle book using
      all seven pieces without overlap.

      Despite its relatively recent emergence in the West, there is a much older
      tradition of dissection amusements in China which likely played a role in
      its inspiration. In particular, the modular banquet tables of the Song
      dynasty bear an uncanny resemblance to the playing pieces of the tangram
      and there were books dedicated to arranging them together to form pleasing
      patterns.

      Several Chinese sources broadly report a well-known Song dynasty polymath
      Huang Bosi 黄伯思 who developed a form of entertainment for his dinner
      guests based on creative arrangements of six small tables called 宴几 or
      燕几 (feast tables or swallow tables respectively). One diagram shows
      these as oblong rectangles, and other reports suggest a seventh table was
      added later, perhaps by a later inventor.

      According to Western sources, however, the tangram's historical Chinese
      inventor is unknown except through the pen name Yang-cho-chu-shih
      (Dim-witted (?) recluse, recluse = 处士). It is believed that the puzzle
      was originally introduced in a book titled Ch'i chi'iao t'u, which was
      already reported as lost in 1815 by Shan-chiao in his book New Figures of
      the Tangram. Nevertheless, it is generally believed that the puzzle was
      invented about 20 years earlier.

      The prominent third-century mathematician Liu Hui made use of construction
      proofs in his works and some bear a striking resemblance to the
      subsequently developed banquet tables which in turn seem to anticipate the
      tangram. While there is no reason to suspect that tangrams were used in
      the proof of the Pythagorean theorem, as is sometimes reported, it is
      likely that this style of geometric reasoning went on to exert an
      influence on Chinese cultural life that lead directly to the puzzle.

      The early years of attempting to date the Tangram were confused by the
      popular but fraudulently written history by famed puzzle maker Samuel Loyd
      in his 1908 The Eighth Book Of Tan. This work contains many whimsical
      features that aroused both interest and suspicion amongst contemporary
      scholars who attempted to verify the account. By 1910 it was clear that it
      was a hoax. A letter dated from this year from the Oxford Dictionary
      editor Sir James Murray on behalf of a number of Chinese scholars to the
      prominent puzzlist Henry Dudeney reads "The result has been to show that
      the man Tan, the god Tan, and the Book of Tan are entirely unknown to
      Chinese literature, history or tradition." Along with its many strange
      details The Eighth Book of Tan's date of creation for the puzzle of 4000
      years in antiquity had to be regarded as entirely baseless and false.
