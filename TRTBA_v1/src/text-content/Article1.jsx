      A mechanical puzzle is a puzzle presented as a set of mechanically
      interlinked pieces in which the solution is to manipulate the whole object
      or parts of it.

    <p>
      The oldest known mechanical puzzle comes from Greece and appeared in the
      3rd century BC. The game consists of a square divided into 14 parts, and
      the aim was to create different shapes from these pieces. This is not easy
      to do. (see Ostomachion loculus Archimedius)

    <p>In Iran "puzzle-locks" were made as early as the 17th century AD.</p>

      The next known occurrence of puzzles is in Japan. In 1742 there is a
      mention of a game called "Sei Shona-gon Chie No-Ita" in a book. Around the
      year 1800 the Tangram puzzle from China became popular, and 20 years later
      it had spread through Europe and America.

      The company Richter from Rudolstadt began producing large amounts of
      Tangram-like puzzles of different shapes, the so-called "Anker-puzzles" in
      about 1891.

      In 1893, Angelo John Lewis, using the pen name "Professor Hoffman", wrote
      a book called Puzzles; Old and New. It contained, among other things, more
      than 40 descriptions of puzzles with secret opening mechanisms. This book
      grew into a reference work for puzzle games and modern copies exist for
      those interested.

      The beginning of the 20th century was a time in which puzzles were greatly
      fashionable and the first patents for puzzles were recorded.

      With the invention of modern polymers manufacture of many puzzles became
      easier and cheaper.

      In 1993, Jerry Slocum founded the Slocum Puzzle Foundation, a non-profit
      organization dedicated to educating the public on puzzles through puzzle
      collecting, exhibitions, publications, and communications.
