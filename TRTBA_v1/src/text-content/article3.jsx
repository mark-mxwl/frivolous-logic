      The Oxford English Dictionary dates the word puzzle (as a verb) to the end
      of the 16th century. Its earliest use documented in the OED was in a book
      titled The Voyage of Robert Dudley...to the West Indies, 1594â€“95, narrated
      by Capt. Wyatt, by himself, and by Abram Kendall, master (published circa
      1595). The word later came to be used as a noun, first as an abstract noun
      meaning 'the state or condition of being puzzled', and later developing
      the meaning of 'a perplexing problem'. The OED's earliest clear citation
      in the sense of 'a toy that tests the player's ingenuity' is from Sir
      Walter Scott's 1814 novel Waverley, referring to a toy known as a "reel in
      a bottle".

      The etymology of the verb puzzle is described by OED as "unknown";
      unproven hypotheses regarding its origin include an Old English verb
      puslian meaning 'pick out', and a derivation of the verb pose.

      Jigsaw puzzles are perhaps the most popular form of puzzle. Jigsaw puzzles
      were invented around 1760, when John Spilsbury, a British engraver and
      cartographer, mounted a map on a sheet of wood, which he then sawed around
      the outline of each individual country on the map. He then used the
      resulting pieces as an aid for the teaching of geography.

      After becoming popular among the public, this kind of teaching aid
      remained the primary use of jigsaw puzzles until about 1820.

      The puzzles that were first documented are riddles. In Europe, Greek
      mythology produced riddles like the riddle of the Sphinx. Many riddles
      were produced during the Middle Ages, as well.

      By the early 20th century, magazines and newspapers found that they could
      increase their readership by publishing puzzle contests, beginning with
      crosswords and in modern days sudoku.
