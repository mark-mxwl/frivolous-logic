      A puzzle box (also called a secret box or trick box) is a box that can be
      opened only by solving a puzzle. Some require only a simple move and
      others a series of discoveries.

      Modern puzzle boxes developed from furniture and jewelry boxes with secret
      compartments and hidden openings, known since the Renaissance. Puzzle
      boxes produced for entertainment first appeared in Victorian England in
      the 19th century and as tourist souvenirs in the Interlaken region in
      Switzerland and in the Hakone region of Japan at the end of the 19th and
      the beginning of the 20th century. Boxes with secret openings appeared as
      souvenirs at other tourist destinations during the early 20th century,
      including the Amalfi Coast, Madeira, and Sri Lanka, though these were
      mostly 'one-trick' traditions. Chinese cricket boxes represent another
      example of intricate boxes with secret openings.

      Interest in puzzle boxes subsided during and after the two World Wars. The
      art was revived in the 1980s by three pioneers of this genre: Akio Kamei
      in Japan, Trevor Wood in England, and Frank Chambers in Ireland. There are
      currently a number of artists producing puzzle boxes, including the
      Karakuri group in Japan set up by Akio Kamei, US puzzle box specialists
      Robert Yarger and Kagen Sound, as well as a number of other designers and
      puzzle makers who produce puzzle boxes across the globe.

      Clive Barker's horror novella The Hellbound Heart (later adapted into a
      film, Hellraiser, followed by numerous original sequels) centers on the
      fictional Lemarchand's box, a puzzle box which opens the gates to another
      dimension when manipulated.
