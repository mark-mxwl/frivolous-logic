      The Tower of Hanoi (also called The problem of Benares Temple or Tower
      of Brahma or Lucas' Tower and sometimes pluralized as Towers, or simply
      pyramid puzzle) is a mathematical game or puzzle consisting of three
      rods and a number of disks of various diameters, which can slide onto any
      rod.

    <p>
      The puzzle was invented by the French mathematician Édouard Lucas in 1883.
      Numerous myths regarding the ancient and mystical nature of the puzzle
      popped up almost immediately, including a myth about an Indian temple
      in Kashi Vishwanath containing a large room with three time-worn posts in
      it, surrounded by 64 golden disks. But, this story of Indian Kashi
      Vishwanath temple was spread tongue-in-cheek by a friend of Édouard
      Lucas.

      If the legend were true, and if the priests were able to move disks at a
      rate of one per second, using the smallest number of moves, it would take
      them 2<sup>64</sup> − 1 seconds or roughly 585 billion years to finish, which is
      about 42 times the estimated current age of the universe.
    </p>

    <p>
      There are many variations on this legend. For instance, in some tellings,
      the temple is a monastery, and the priests are monks. The temple or
      monastery may be in various locales including Hanoi, and may be associated
      with any religion. In some versions, other elements are introduced, such
      as the fact that the tower was created at the beginning of the world, or
      that the priests or monks may make only one move per day.
