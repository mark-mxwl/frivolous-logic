      The 15 Puzzle (also called Gem Puzzle, Boss Puzzle, Game of Fifteen,
      Mystic Square and many others) is a sliding puzzle which has 15 square
      tiles numbered 1 to 15 in a frame that is 4 tile positions high and 4
      positions wide, with one unoccupied position.

      The puzzle was "invented" by Noyes Palmer Chapman, a postmaster in
      Canastota, New York, who is said to have shown friends, as early as 1874,
      a precursor puzzle consisting of 16 numbered blocks that were to be put
      together in rows of four, each summing to 34 (see magic square). Copies of
      the improved 15 Puzzle made their way to Syracuse, New York, by way of
      Noyes' son, Frank, and from there, via sundry connections, to Watch Hill,
      Rhode Island, and finally to Hartford (Connecticut), where students in the
      American School for the Deaf started manufacturing the puzzle and, by
      December 1879, selling them both locally and in Boston, Massachusetts.
      Shown one of these, Matthias Rice, who ran a fancy woodworking business in
      Boston, started manufacturing the puzzle sometime in December 1879 and
      convinced a "Yankee Notions" fancy goods dealer to sell them under the
      name of "Gem Puzzle". In late January 1880, Charles Pevey, a dentist in
      Worcester, Massachusetts, garnered some attention by offering a cash
      reward for a solution to the Fifteen Puzzle.

      Noyes Chapman had applied for a patent on his "Block Solitaire Puzzle" on
      February 21, 1880. However, that patent was rejected, likely because it
      was not sufficiently different from the August 20, 1878 "Puzzle-Blocks"
      patent (US 207124) granted to Ernest U. Kinsey.

      Sam Loyd claimed--from 1891 until his death in 1911--that he had invented
      the puzzle. However, Loyd had nothing to do with the invention or initial
      popularity of the puzzle, and in any case, the craze was in 1880, not the
      early 1870s. Loyd's first article about the puzzle was published in 1886,
      and it was not until 1891 that he first claimed to be the
      inventor.

      Some later interest was fueled by Loyd's offer of a $1,000 prize to anyone
      who could provide a solution for achieving a particular combination
      specified by Loyd, namely reversing the 14 and 15, which Loyd called the
      14-15 puzzle. This is impossible, as had been shown over a decade
      earlier by Johnson & Story (1879), because it requires a transformation
      from an even to an odd permutation.
